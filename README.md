API Documentation
This is what developers will most likely want to see and should understand.
https://docs.api.brandsgateway.com/
 
API Callback URL
This is where they send their API requests in their code
https://v1.api.brandsgateway.com/
 
Here is the what the process is:
1.) Your developer can review the API, but they won't be able to integrat it because they will need the username and password for the API Callback
2.) We send you a payment request using 2checkout that is paid with your credit card.
3.) Once payment is confirmed I will send you the username and password for the API
4.) Start integration with our API - if your developers have any questions just let me know. But so far it has been working without any issues.
5.) We suggest to do a advance deposit of 500euro instead of waiting for payment for each order that will minimize the risk of double selling.
 
If you have any questions, you can message me on whatsapp or email me the details.
 
Looking forward to this partnership :)
